## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS has been added to this project. The global Tailwind stylesheet is at `assets/css/tailwind.css` and is included via `nuxt.config.ts`.

Install (if you haven't already):

```bash
# using pnpm (recommended in this repo)
pnpm add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

If you need to regenerate the Tailwind config, run:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then run the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
